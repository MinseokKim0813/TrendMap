# Ethics in TreandMap Project

## Introduction

The **TreandMap** project is dedicated to providing real-time insights into the media presence of the most profitable American companies. By integrating data from the New York Times (NYT) API, web scraping from [companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/most-profitable-american-companies/), and dynamic web scraping from the SEC EDGAR Search website, TreandMap offers a comprehensive view of industry and state trends in media mentions. This document outlines the ethical considerations addressed throughout the development and deployment of the TreandMap project.

## Ethical Considerations

### 1. **Compliance with Terms of Service**

- **Web Scraping**:

  - **CompaniesMarketCap.com**: TreandMap adheres strictly to the [Terms of Service](https://companiesmarketcap.com/terms-of-service/) of CompaniesMarketCap.com. Only publicly accessible data is scraped, ensuring that no private or restricted information is accessed or used.
  - **SEC EDGAR Search**: The SEC provides public access to company filings through EDGAR. TreandMap ensures that all scraping activities comply with the SEC’s [Terms of Use](https://www.sec.gov/privacy.htm), avoiding any prohibited actions.

- **API Usage**:
  - **New York Times API**: TreandMap fully complies with the NYT API’s [Terms of Use](https://developer.nytimes.com/faq#a11). The API is used solely for the purposes outlined in the project, and all usage limits and guidelines are strictly followed.

### 2. **Respecting Rate Limits and Server Load**

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - **NYT API**: TreandMap respects the NYT API’s rate limits of **500 requests per day** and **5 requests per minute**. To adhere to these limits, the project implements a delay of 12 seconds between each API request, ensuring that the rate limits are not exceeded. For more details, refer to the [NYT API FAQ](https://developer.nytimes.com/faq#a11).
  - **Web Scraping**: When scraping data from CompaniesMarketCap.com and SEC EDGAR, TreandMap incorporates delays between requests to prevent overwhelming the servers and to minimize the impact on website performance.

### 3. **Data Privacy and Security**

- **Data Handling**:
  - TreandMap exclusively collects publicly available information about companies, such as financial performance, industry classification, and geographic location. No personal or sensitive data of individuals is collected, ensuring compliance with data privacy standards.
- **API Key Security**:
  - The NYT API key is securely managed and is not exposed in the public repository. Users are instructed to replace the placeholder API key with their own, ensuring that sensitive credentials are protected and not inadvertently shared.

### 4. **Transparency and Attribution**

- **Data Sources**:
  - All data sources used in TreandMap, including the NYT API, CompaniesMarketCap.com, and SEC EDGAR, are clearly documented in the project’s `README.md`. This transparency allows users to understand the origin of the data and the methods used for collection.
- **Acknowledgment**:
  - TreandMap acknowledges and credits the use of third-party services and APIs, giving proper attribution to data providers and respecting their contributions.

### 5. **Intellectual Property and Licensing**

- **Data Usage**:
  - TreandMap ensures that the data collected through web scraping and API usage does not infringe on intellectual property rights. Only data that is legally permissible to use and redistribute is included in the dataset.
- **Licensing Compliance**:
  - Users are informed about the licensing terms of the data sources and are encouraged to comply with any specific licensing requirements when using the dataset. This includes adhering to usage restrictions and attribution guidelines as stipulated by the data providers.

### 6. **Responsible Data Usage**

- **Purpose Limitation**:
  - The dataset generated by TreandMap is intended solely for analysis and informational purposes. It is not designed to be used for any malicious activities, such as market manipulation or unauthorized data harvesting.
- **User Responsibility**:
  - Users of the TreandMap dataset are encouraged to utilize the data responsibly, respecting the rights and privacy of the companies included. Ethical usage ensures that the data serves to inform and analyze rather than exploit.

### 7. **Accountability and Continuous Improvement**

- **Error Handling**:
  - TreandMap incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected issues gracefully. This ensures that the scraping and data collection processes do not inadvertently cause harm or violate ethical standards.
- **Feedback and Updates**:
  - TreandMap remains open to feedback regarding its ethical practices and is committed to making necessary adjustments to enhance ethical compliance continually. This includes staying updated with changes in terms of service, privacy policies, and best practices in data handling.

## Conclusion

The **TreandMap** project is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in data collection, processing, and usage. By adhering to terms of service, respecting rate limits, ensuring data privacy and security, maintaining transparency, complying with intellectual property laws, promoting responsible data usage, and fostering accountability, TreandMap aims to provide valuable insights while respecting the rights and integrity of all stakeholders involved.
